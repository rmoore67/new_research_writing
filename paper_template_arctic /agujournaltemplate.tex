%source = \url{https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Map-showing-the-27-first-order-weather-stations-red-dots-poleward-of-60N_fig2_287491057}
- there are few stations
- these are my key sites for comparison

- of the stations there is little data

end 
my key validation period is 
my key stations are 
this is where I have sufficient data

\cite{Mahrt1987}
supplemental - if I change time period I get the same results

\subsubsection{Observational data available}
What is the data
sensors, precision, limits from a gauge 
set up for rain and snow = discontinuity
minimum amount of precip that I can record

\subsection{Reanalysis}
reanalysis is xxx
ERA5 is xxx
Why did I choose to use ERA5

(standard paragraph of this)

\subsubsection{Variables in reanalysis}

how can you describe the variables  
what does the literature say about how much we can trust them 

this is precip, this is what is analysed, there is convective and large scale
there is an issue with TP - this is corrected for in the literature 

variable at a certain time step, this is how you work with them
This is how we use the spun up precip data 

\subsection{Methods}
\subsubsection{Data correction}
selected and sorted (mentioned above) plotted meteorological data 

1. extract one grid point of ERA5 (nearest neighbour) as opposed to 6 which are closest
- this method is a choice, sometimes this can be misplaced, looked at this in the supplement so that i do not have an issue with misplaced results

prob 1 2. we have known issues with ERA - too much TP 
remove from the gauge as it evaporates

problem 2 3. deal with amount of precip - amount is 10 times too small, fixed this show a plot of before and after 

\begin{figure}[h!tbp]]
\noindent\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/plot_in_progress.png}
\caption{ERA correction TP}
\end{figure}


threshold 

- how I scaled this, 10 year decadal mean 
- evaluation of this method - does it work?
still need to work on this ....
1. monthly is sum of daily?
2. compare to Vancouver weather or somewhere else where ERA is good


subsection
- metrics that I choose and why these are good metrics
- What is it that I am trying to do?
- want to see precip quanity, frequency, list of variables, how used what they mean, how computed

\subsubsection{Weather \& climatology}
1. evaluate changes in number of events 

processing ERA5
- remove TP, correct for accumulation

method for comparasion

\section{Results}

\subsection{Seasonal cycle and climatology}
method - take period afterage or first 30 year average etc, ? - is this stable enough to do this ?

plot annual cycle? base climatology before large changes

comment on climatology - winter months, spring - is coupled or decoupled with precipitation and temperature, 

based on this = this is how I define my seasons - 4 seasons - based on my climatology

\begin{figure}[h!tbp]]
\centering
\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.55\textwidth}
   \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/temperature_climatologly_tuktoyaktuk.png}

   \caption{}
   \label{fig:Ng2}
\end{subfigure}

\caption{Plot showing seasons, annual cycle of temperature and precipitation}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{evaluating the climatology in ERA}
era is not doing enough in summer vs winter 
subdued seasonal cycle 
assimilated temperature as assimilation but not perfect
seems to start spring earlier or later 



I am seeing an interesting pattern 
first month when precip is double , map onto the whole of ERA - how representative is my data point over the general area (show this in the methods section)

with a proper description of what is in the plot
needs to be very percise, numbers or \%
ERA is understmating spring precip by 20\% etc


\begin{figure}[h!tbp]]
\noindent\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/plot_in_progress.png}
\caption{Plot showing same climatology in ERA}
\end{figure}



\subsection{climatology of extreme events}
definition of extreme events - consistent with literature or not?




    \begin{figure}[h!tbp]][!ht]

    \begin{subfigure}{0.45\linewidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/cdf_pdf/pdf_accum_alert_10_20.png}

\caption{Hist, CDF and PDF, showing where the extreme of 85\% is coming from}
    \label{fig:my figure}
    \end{figure}





explain whether you can use a special threshold per site?

or more simple and have the exact same result?

is the meaning of the results the same in each case?
1. precip distribution (plots)



\begin{figure}[h!tbp]]
\centering
\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.55\textwidth}
   \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/accum_extreme_days_tuk_00_10.png}
   \caption{}

   \caption{}
   \label{fig:Ng2}
\end{subfigure}

\caption{Number of extreme precip days per season, with subplot of accumulation due to extremes}
\end{figure}




plot for precntile to define extremes
 show a comparasion of whether you need a different level for different sites or not

\subsubsection{evaluation of ERA for extremes}
 
2. does era show the same (plots)

\begin{figure}[h!tbp]]
\noindent\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/plot_in_progress.png}
\caption{Number of extreme precip days per season - ERA comparasion, with subplot of accumulation due to extremes}
\end{figure}



describe what these show


seasonal number of events
we have more events in summer - expected as precip is higher when warmer
ERA finds all events 
occurrence is well characterised once you massage data
this is not obvious that these would be the same

can trust ERA to find these events


- evaluation of era is good at occurrence, is the amount or the proportionality of the amount also good?
or even after correction does it still underestimate?

is the percentage of annual precipitation described by these events



--- 

\subsection{Attribution/mechanisms of events}


----
\subsubsection{variability}
what drives variability 
what makes seasons different?

----
temperature vs no. of extreme days 

\begin{figure}[h!tbp]]
\centering
\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.55\textwidth}
   \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/year_extreme_temp_precip_days_tuk_00_10.png}
   \caption{}
   \label{fig:Ng1}

   \caption{}
   \label{fig:Ng2}
\end{subfigure}

\caption{Temperature and extreme days }
\end{figure}


as a diagnostic of what drives extremes 

good to do for climatology too 

expect / normal 

expect more in summer time, showed already 



no. at tuk in winter - dynamical origin - very different mechanisms 


\subsubsection{trends}
- looking at yearly trends and changes


total time trends

\begin{figure}[h!tbp]]
\centering
\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.55\textwidth}
   \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/decadal_seasonal_daily_precip_trend_tuk.png}
   \caption{}

   \caption{}
   \label{fig:Ng2}
\end{subfigure}

\caption{Precipitation and temperature trend }
\end{figure}



Q1 is the number of precip days per month and year?

- within months
- within years 

\begin{figure}[h!tbp]]
\centering
\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.55\textwidth}
   \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/no_precip_days_per_month_tuk_10_20.png}

   \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/no_precip_days_per_year_tuk_10_20.png}
   \caption{}
   \label{fig:Ng2}
\end{subfigure}

\caption{No. precip days per month and per year - show that this has changed ?? needs work }
\end{figure}



Q2 is the accumulative yearly / monthly precip changing?


\begin{figure}[h!tbp]]
\centering
\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.55\textwidth}
   \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/precip_accum_per_month_tuk_00_10.png}
   \caption{}
   \label{fig:Ng1}

\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.55\textwidth}
   \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/precip_accum_per_year_tuk_20_10.png}
   \caption{}
   \label{fig:Ng2}
\end{subfigure}

\caption{accumulative yearly / monthly precip - has this changed? }
\end{figure}





trend in temp and precip 
how do i describe
what is the signal
how do i make a relationship between these?

is my amount of precip increasing due to xxx

if correlation make a plot of this 


what is special about this climatology?

% Single-line equations are centered.
% Equation arrays will appear left-aligned.

Math coded inside display math mode \[ ...\]
 will not be numbered, e.g.,:
 \[ x^2=y^2 + z^2\]

 Math coded inside \begin{equation} and \end{equation} will
 be automatically numbered, e.g.,:
 \begin{equation}
 x^2=y^2 + z^2
 \end{equation}


% To create multiline equations, use the
% \begin{eqnarray} and \end{eqnarray} environment
% as demonstrated below.
\begin{eqnarray}
  x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta  \nonumber \\
  y_{1} & = & -(x - x_{0}) \sin \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \cos \Theta.
\end{eqnarray}

%If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:
%\begin{eqnarray*}...\end{eqnarray*}

% Break each line at a sign of operation
% (+, -, etc.) if possible, with the sign of operation
% on the new line.

% Indent second and subsequent lines to align with
% the first character following the equal sign on the
% first line.

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space
% into your equation if necessary. Place an appropriate
% unit of measure between the curly braces, e.g.
% \hspace{1in}; you may have to experiment to achieve
% the correct amount of space.

%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting
% the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.

% If you are using line numbers, remember to surround
% equations with \begin{linenomath*}...\end{linenomath*}

%  To add line numbers to lines in equations:
%  \begin{linenomath*}
%  \begin{equation}
%  \end{equation}
%  \end{linenomath*}
