abstract={The Galileo spacecraft has been orbiting Jupiter since 7 December 1995, and encounters one of the four galilean satellites---Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto---on each orbit. Initial results from the spacecraft's magnetometer1,2 have indicated that neither Europa nor Callisto have an appreciable internal magnetic field, in contrast to Ganymede3 and possibly Io4. Here we report perturbations of the external magnetic fields (associated with Jupiter's inner magnetosphere) in the vicinity of both Europa and Callisto. We interpret these perturbations as arising from induced magnetic fields, generated by the moons in response to the periodically varying plasma environment. Electromagnetic induction requires eddy currents to flow within the moons, and our calculations show that the most probable explanation is that there are layers of significant electrical conductivity just beneath the surfaces of both moons. We argue that these conducting layers may best be explained by the presence of salty liquid-water oceans, for which there is already indirect geological evidence5,6 in the case of Europa.},

Recent progresses have well established the concept of “elastic heterogeneity”, i.e., disordered materials show spatially inhomogeneous elastic moduli. In this study, by using molecular-dynamics simulations, we gradually introduce “disorder” into a numerical system to control its modulus heterogeneity. The system starts from a perfect crystalline state, progressively transforms into an increasingly disordered crystalline state, and finally undergoes structural amorphisation. We monitor independently the elastic heterogeneity, the vibrational states, and the thermal conductivity across this transition, and show that the heterogeneity in elastic moduli is well correlated to vibrational and thermal anomalies of the disordered system.}

abstract = {An evaluation of the historical record of volcanic eruptions shows that subaerial volcanism increases globally by two to six times above background levels between 12ka and 7ka, during the last deglaciation. Increased volcanism occurs in deglaciating regions. Causal mechanisms could include an increase in magma production owing to the mantle decompression caused by ablation of glaciers and ice caps or a more general pacing of when eruptions occur by the glacial variability. A corollary is that ocean ridge volcanic production should decrease with the rising sea level during deglaciation, with the greatest effect at slow spreading ridges. CO2 output from the increased subaerial volcanism appears large enough to influence glacial/interglacial CO2 variations. We estimate subaerial emissions during deglaciation to be between 1000 and 5000Gt of CO2 above the long term average background flux, assuming that emissions are proportional to the frequency of eruptions. After accounting for equilibration with the ocean, this additional CO2 flux is consistent in timing and magnitude with ice core observations of a 40ppm increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration during the second half of the last deglaciation. }

abstract = {Abstract Idealized models or emulators of volcanic aerosol forcing have been widely used to reconstruct the spatiotemporal evolution of past volcanic forcing. However, existing models, including the most recently developed Easy Volcanic Aerosol (EVA; Toohey et al., doi: 10.5194/gmd-2016-83), (i) do not account for the height of injection of volcanic SO ; (ii) prescribe a vertical structure for the forcing; and (iii) are often calibrated against a single eruption. We present a new idealized model, EVA\_H, that addresses these limitations. Compared to EVA, EVA\_H makes predictions of the global mean stratospheric aerosol optical depth that are (i) similar for the 1979–1998 period characterized by the large and high-altitude tropical SO injections of El Chichón (1982) and Mount Pinatubo (1991); (ii) significantly improved for the 1998–2015 period characterized by smaller eruptions with a large variety of injection latitudes and heights. Compared to EVA, the sensitivity of volcanic forcing to injection latitude and height in EVA\_H is much more consistent with results from climate models that include interactive aerosol chemistry and microphysics, even though EVA\_H remains less sensitive to eruption latitude than the latter models. We apply EVA\_H to investigate potential biases and uncertainties in EVA-based volcanic forcing data sets from phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). EVA and EVA\_H forcing reconstructions do not significantly differ for tropical high-altitude volcanic injections. However, for high-latitude or low-altitude injections, our reconstructed forcing is significantly lower. This suggests that volcanic forcing in CMIP6 last millenium experiments may be overestimated for such eruptions.},

abstract = {Satellite instruments have been providing measurements of global volcanic emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) since 1978, based on observations in the ultraviolet (UV), infrared (IR) and microwave spectral bands. We review recent advances in satellite remote sensing of volcanic gases, focusing on increased instrument sensitivity to tropospheric SO2 emissions and techniques to determine volcanic plume altitude. A synthesis of ~36years of global UV, IR and microwave satellite measurements yields an updated assessment of the volcanic SO2 flux to the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) between 1978 and 2014 (~1–2Tg/yr). The present availability of multiple UV and IR satellite SO2 products provides increased confidence in calculated SO2 loadings for many eruptions. We examine the temporal and latitudinal distribution of volcanic SO2 emissions and reassess the relationship between eruptive SO2 discharge and eruption magnitude, finding a first-order correlation between SO2 emission and volcanic explosivity index (VEI), but with significant scatter. Based on the observed SO2-VEI relation, we estimate the fraction of eruptive SO2 emissions released by the smallest eruptions (~0.48Tg/yr), which is not recorded by satellite observations. A detailed breakdown of the sources of measured SO2 emissions reveals intuitively expected correlations between eruption frequency, SO2 loading and volcanic degassing style. We discuss new constraints on e-folding times for SO2 removal in volcanic plumes, and highlight recent measurements of volcanic hydrogen chloride (HCl) injections into the UTLS. An analysis of passive volcanic emissions of SO2 detected in Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) SO2 data since 2004 provides new insight into the location and stability of the dominant sources of volcanic SO2 over the past decade. Since volcanic SO2 emissions constitute a random, highly variable perturbation to the atmosphere-climate system, continued monitoring of volcanic SO2 emissions from space by multiple UV and IR instruments to extend the current multi-decadal record is essential, and near-global, geostationary measurements of SO2 may be available by the end of the current decade.}
